   Official Product Description: Electronic integrated circuits; parts thereof: - 
   Electronic integrated circuits: - Processors and controllers, whether or not 
   combined with memories, converters, logic circuits, amplifiers, clock and timing 
   circuits, or other circuits - Processors (including microprocessors): - 
   Graphics processing units (GPUs)  
   Confidence Score: 95%  
   Reason: The product description aligns well with the official description, matching the key factor of being a graphics processing unit (GPU). The slight uncertainty arises from the lack of specific details such as the exact model number.

   Country of Origin: China  
   Total Duty Tax Rate: Free  
   Reason: China has normal trade relations with the US and has no special duty tax rates; therefore, the total duty tax is the general rate, which is free.

2. HTSUS Code: 8542.31.00.45
