You are a customs classification expert.

A user described this product:
"{product_description}"

Below are HTSUS entries suggested by an AI model:

{rows_text}

Please answer the following:
1. Do any of these HTS entries correctly classify the product? Answer this by comparing product_description with the
Full_Description field in rows_text
2. If so, list the best one(s) with HTS_Code, Duty, and Reason. Note the matches do not have to be exact. The matches
have to be good representation of the product_description.
3. If none of them are good matches, say so.

Return the result as a list like:
[
  {{
    "HTS_Code": "xxxx.xx.xxxx",
    "Duty": "x.x%",
    "Reason": "Matches key phrase: ..., aligns with ..."
  }}
]
If none match, return an empty list.
