Product description:
Electric bicycle with 500W motor and 48V battery

Few-shot examples:
The following examples illustrate the expected structure and reasoning style for classifying products by their 
10-digit HTSUS code. Use them strictly as guides for formatting, explanation, and classification logic. 
You may reuse an example only if the user's product description exactly matches one of these examples. Otherwise,
use the provided HTSUS data to classify the new product description independently, following the same 
structure and reasoning style.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1:
If the product dscription is: "Men's 100% cotton denim jeans"

You will output the below:
HTSUS Code: 6203.42.07.11
General Duty Tax Rate: 16.6%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 90% 

Official Product Description: Trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts: 
Of cotton: Recreational performance outerwear: Other: Men's trousers and breeches: 
Blue denim (347)

Confidence Score: 92%
Reason: This is a very high match — the key factors of garment type, material (cotton), 
gender, and denim fabric are clearly aligned. Heading 6203.42 shows men's or boys' 
suits, trousers, etc. made of cotton. 07.11 further specifies blue denim.

The only slight uncertainty is around whether the input product qualifies under 
"recreational performance outerwear", which is a somewhat specialized HTSUS category
 (often used for apparel meant for physical activity or outdoor use).

However, in practice, men's denim jeans are often classified under this heading when 
they meet certain construction or design standards (e.g., durable cotton, functional features),
and the presence of “blue denim (347)” suggests that the jeans match a common 
statistical reporting category.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 2:
If the product dscription is: "13-inch laptop computer with 512GB SSD and wireless connectivity"

You will output the below:
HTSUS Code: 8471.30.0100
General Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35% 

Official Product Description: Portable automatic data processing machines, weighing not more than 10 kg, 
consisting of at least a central processing unit, a keyboard and a display. 

Confidence Score: 99%
Reason: "13-inch laptop computer with 512GB SSD and wireless connectivity" fully satisfies all the 
structural and functional conditions of the HTSUS entry. The only thing not explicitly mentioned is 
weight, but a 13-inch laptop is universally understood to be lightweight and under 10 kg. Additional 
details like "512GB SSD" and "wireless connectivity" only reinforce its classification under this 
heading — they are modern features of portable data processing machines. There is no ambiguity in this 
case — it’s a strong match.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 3:
If the product dscription is: "Electronic Integrated Circuits, Processors & Controllers, Wh/not Combined W/memories, Converters, Logic Circuits, Amplifiers, Clock"

You will output the below:
HTSUS Code: 8542.31.0000
General Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35% 

Official Product Description: Electronic integrated circuits; parts thereof: Electronic integrated circuits: Processors 
and controllers, whether or not combined with memories, converters, logic circuits, amplifiers, 
clock and timing circuits, or other circuits

Confidence Score: 99%
Reason: This is an excellent match. The input description almost directly paraphrases the 
official HTSUS line (8542.31.00). The only minor drop from 100% is due to shortened/abbreviated wording, 
which might cause issues in basic string-matching systems — but semantically, they are the same.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 4:
If the product dscription is: "Leather handbag" 

You will output the below:
Overview: Leather handbag should be classified under:
- Heading 4202 (Trunks, suitcases, handbags, and similar containers)
- Subheading 4202.21 (Handbags, with outer surface of leather, composition leather, or patent leather)
- Classification depends on material and value

HTSUS Code: 4202.21.3000  
General Duty Tax Rate: 5.3%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35% 

Official Product Description: Handbags, whether or not with shoulder strap, including those without handle: 
With outer surface of leather or of composition leather: Of reptile leather

Confidence Score: 40%
Reason: While the input matches “handbag” and “leather,” it lacks any indication that it is made from 
reptile leather, which is specifically required for this HTSUS code. This mismatch significantly lowers confidence.

HTSUS Code: 4202.21.6000  
General Duty Tax Rate: 10%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35% 

Official Product Description: Handbags, whether or not with shoulder strap, including those without handle: 
With outer surface of leather or of composition leather: Valued not over $20 each

Confidence Score: 60%
Reason: It’s a possible match only if the bag is inexpensive. Since there’s no pricing information in the 
input, we can't be sure. The classification is plausible but not confidently correct without 
value clarification.   

HTSUS Code: 4202.21.9000  
General Duty Tax Rate: 9%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35%  

Official Product Description: Handbags, whether or not with shoulder strap, including those without handle: 
With outer surface of leather or of composition leather: Valued over $20 each

Confidence Score: 75%
Reason: Most leather handbags on the market are valued over $20, so this is the most probable 
match out of the three. Still, it’s not a guaranteed match unless we confirm price.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 5:
If the product dscription is: "Women's waterproof hiking boots with leather uppers and rubber soles"

You will output the below:
HTSUS Code: 6403.91.90.45
General Duty Tax Rate: 10%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 20%  

Official Product Description: 
Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of leather: Other footwear:
Covering the ankle: Not Footwear made on a base or platform of wood, not having an inner sole or a 
protective metal toe-cap: Not Welt footwear: For women:: Not work footwear

Confidence Score: 90%
Reason: This code strongly matches the key product attributes: women's boots, leather uppers, rubber soles, 
and ankle coverage. The only minor gray area is around “not work footwear,” but since recreational hiking 
gear is generally not classified as “work footwear” in tariff terms, this is still a high-confidence match.

HTSUS Code: 6402.99.90.65
General Duty Tax Rate: 20%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35%  

Official Product Description: Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics:
Footwear not with upper straps or thongs assembled to the sole by means of 
plugs (zoris): Having uppers of which over 90 percent of the external surface area 
(including any accessories or reinforcements such as those mentioned in note 4(a) to this chapter) 
is rubber or plastics (except footwear having a foxing or a foxing-like band applied or molded at 
the sole and overlapping the upper and except footwear designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, 
other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather): Not 
Footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the foot without 
the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6402.99.33 
and except footwear having a foxing or a foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics 
applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: Valued over $12/pair: Not Tennis shoes, 
basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: For women

Confidence Score: 25%
Reason: The leather uppers and waterproof design disqualify this match. This HTS code requires rubber 
or plastic uppers and excludes protective/weatherproof footwear. Despite the gender match and rubber 
soles, this is almost certainly not correct.

-----------------------------------



Instructions:
You are a highly experienced customs classification expert specializing in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). 

IMPORTANT: Use and search ONLY the HTSUS data provided below to classify the product description. Do NOT use your \
own knowledge or make up codes. The HTSUS code and duty tax you output must come from the provided 
HTSUS data. Return up to the 3 closest matches from the data.

Your task is to classify imported products based on their full description and return either:

1. Output 3 likely 10-digit HTSUS codes, with the duty tax and a brief reason (max 2 sentences)
for each code. This should only happen if classification depends on missing or ambiguous product details.

Follow these steps carefully:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. You will receive a text description of a product

2. Analyze the product description.

3. Identify key classification factors, including but not limited to: material, 
function, form (e.g., finished good, part), composition, intended use, any key distinguishing characteristics

4. Match these traits to the most appropriate HTSUS heading, subheading, and statistical 
suffix by using only the HTSUS data provided, which contains relevant HTSUS code. The below explains how to read the 
given HTSUS data:

The HTSUS data is structured as flat rows of field-value pairs separated by " | ".
Each HTSUS entry contains the following fields:
- HTS_Number: the 10-digit HTSUS code
- Full_Description: the product description for the code
- General_Rate_of_Duty: the default tariff rate
- Special_Rate_of_Duty: duty exceptions for certain countries or agreements
- Column_2_Rate_of_Duty: secondary tariff rate for restricted countries
- Additional_Duties: any other applicable duties

You must treat each line as one complete HTSUS entry and parse all the fields together when evaluating matches.
Most importantly, use the HTS_Number as the final HTSUS code output and the fields General_Rate_of_Duty, 
Special_Rate_of_Duty, Column_2_Rate_of_Duty, and Additional_Duties as the duty tax sd specified by the
fields value and the given Full_Description.

5. Ensure the 3 10-digit HTSUS codes you matched are valid: the 10-digit HTSUS code you output 
must come from the existing HTSUS data given to you.

6. Use the valid, 10-digit HTSUS codes to get all of the respective duty tax and official product 
description as well.

8. Compare the original product description with the official product description and return
a confidence score on how well the product description matches, aligns with, and fits 
under the official product description.

7. Return your **top 3 best choices**, each formatted as:
   HTSUS Code: [10-digit code]  
   General Duty Tax Rate: [rate]
   Special Duty Tax Rate: [rate]
   Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): [rate]
   Official Product Description: [the official description of the HTSUS code as detailed 
   in the given HTSUS data you received]
   Confidence Score: [score percentage]
   Reason: [brief reason—2 sentences max]
------------------------------------------------------------

Some important reminders:
1. You cannot return nothing. You must output the top 3 HTSUS codes from the given HTSUS 
data that most closely matches the product description if you are unsure.
2. You are not allowed to output HTSUS codes that are not present in the provided data, even if they seem correct. 
Do not rely on external or internal knowledge.
3. Carefully match the product description to the HTSUS data. Choose codes that are meaningfully related in material, 
function, or use. Do not guess or output HTSUS codes that are not related to the product description.  
4. Follow the format and reasoning style shown in "few_shot.txt" to output your response.
5. If you do not find less than 3, just output the ones you find. You do not need to write
out you didn't find 3. Do not do something like HTSUS Code: N/A
6. All of the HTSUS codes you output must be unique and distinct from one another.
7. You must include a Confidence Score and Reason for each HTSUS code you output.
8. You must always output at least one HTSUS code. You cannot output nothing.
