The following examples illustrate the expected structure and reasoning style for classifying products by their 
10-digit HTSUS code. Use them strictly as guides for formatting, explanation, and classification logic. 
You may reuse an example only if the user's product description exactly matches one of these examples. Otherwise,
use the provided HTSUS data to classify the new product description independently, following the same 
structure and reasoning style.

EXAMPLE 2:
If the product dscription is: "Men's 100% cotton denim jeans" 
and origin country is South Korean

You will output the below:
HTSUS Code: 6203.42.07.11
General Duty Tax Rate: 16.6%
Special Duty Tax Rate: 0%
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 90% 
Additional Duties: 0%

Official Product Description: Trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts: 
Of cotton: Recreational performance outerwear: Other: Men's trousers and breeches: 
Blue denim (347)

Confidence Score: 92%
Reason: This is a very high match — the key factors of garment type, material (cotton), 
gender, and denim fabric are clearly aligned. Heading 6203.42 shows men's or boys' 
suits, trousers, etc. made of cotton. 07.11 further specifies blue denim.

The only slight uncertainty is around whether the input product qualifies under 
"recreational performance outerwear", which is a somewhat specialized HTSUS category
 (often used for apparel meant for physical activity or outdoor use).

However, in practice, men's denim jeans are often classified under this heading when 
they meet certain construction or design standards (e.g., durable cotton, functional features),
and the presence of “blue denim (347)” suggests that the jeans match a common 
statistical reporting category.

Country of Origin: South Korea  
Total HTS Duty Tax Rate: 16.6%  
Reason: South Korea does have normal trade relations with the US and has no special duty tax rates;
therefore, the total duty tax is the general rate, 16.6%

EXAMPLE 3:
If the product dscription is: "women's leather boots" with origin country "Cuba"

You will output the below:
1. HTSUS Code: 6404.19.15.60  
General Duty Tax Rate: 10.50%  
Special Duty Tax Rate: Free  
Column 2 Rate (for countries without normal trade relations with US): 35%  
Additional Duties: 0%  

Official Product Description: Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear having uppers of which over 50 percent of the external surface area is leather - For women  
Confidence Score: 95%  
Reason: The product description aligns well with the official description, matching the key factor of leather uppers for women's footwear. The slight uncertainty arises from the lack of specific percentage mentioned in the product description.

Country of Origin: Cuba  
Total HTS Duty Tax Rate: 35%  
Reason: Cuba does not have normal trade relations with the US, so the Column 2 Rate of 35% applies.
 
2. HTSUS Code: 6404.19.36.60  
General Duty Tax Rate: 7.50%  
Special Duty Tax Rate: Free

Confidence Score: 90%  
Reason: The product description matches the official description in terms of open-toe design, slip-on type, and vegetable fiber uppers for women's footwear. The only slight discrepancy is the lack of explicit mention of these details in the product description.

Country of Origin: Cuba  
Total HTS Duty Tax Rate: 35%  
Reason: Cuba does not have normal trade relations with the US, so the Column 2 Rate of 35% applies.

3. HTSUS Code: 6404.19.37.60

Confidence Score: 85%  
Reason: The product description closely matches the official description, particularly in terms of open-toe design, slip-on type, and non-vegetable fiber uppers for women's footwear. The confidence score is slightly lower due to the absence of specific material details in the product description.

Country of Origin: Cuba  
Total HTS Duty Tax Rate: 35%  
Reason: Cuba does not have normal trade relations with the US, so the Column 2 Rate of 35% applies.
